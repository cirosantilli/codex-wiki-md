The [equivalent formulations of orientability of a smooth manifold](../../../differential-geometry.md#equivalent-formulations-of-orientability-of-a-smooth-manifold) are:

- an atlas whose transition maps have positive [Jacobian determinant](../../../calculus.md#jacobian-determinant);
- a smooth choice of one of the two orientations of every [tangent space](../../../differential-geometry.md#tangent-space);
- a nowhere-zero smooth top-degree [differential form](../../../differential-form.md).

A positive chart orients its coordinate frame. Conversely, smoothly oriented frames determine local positive coordinate volume forms. A [partition of unity](../../../differential-geometry.md#partition-of-unity) subordinate to an oriented atlas glues these positive forms: at each point they are positive multiples of one another, so their weighted sum cannot vanish. Finally, a nowhere-zero top form $\omega$ declares $(v_1,\ldots,v_n)$ positive exactly when $\omega(v_1,\ldots,v_n)>0$. These constructions are inverse at the level of orientations.

Let $\Omega$ orient $M\times\mathbb R$ and write $t$ for the coordinate on $\mathbb R$. Along $M\times\{0\}$, contraction with the transverse vector $\partial_t$ gives

$$
\omega=\iota_{\partial_t}\Omega\big|_{M\times\{0\}}.
$$

For every basis of $T_pM$, adjoining $\partial_t$ gives a basis of $T_{(p,0)}(M\times\mathbb R)$, so $\omega$ never vanishes. The top form $\omega$ orients $M$.

Assume $M\times N$ is oriented. Fix $q\in N$ and an ordered basis $(w_1,\ldots,w_n)$ of $T_qN$. Contracting the product orientation successively with the constant vectors $w_i$ along $M\times\{q\}$ produces a nowhere-zero top form on $M$. Hence $M$ is orientable. Fixing a point and a basis in $M$ gives an orientation of $N$ in the same way. This is the [orientability of factors of a product manifold](../../../differential-geometry.md#orientability-of-factors-of-a-product-manifold).

An [immersed submanifold](../../../differential-geometry.md#immersed-submanifold) of $M$ is a manifold $N$ with an injective [immersion](../../../differential-geometry.md#immersion) $\iota:N\to M$. It is an [embedded submanifold](../../../differential-geometry.md#embedded-submanifold) when $\iota$ is also a homeomorphism onto its image with the subspace topology, equivalently when it is a [smooth embedding](../../../differential-geometry.md#smooth-embedding).

Because the inclusion $\iota:N\hookrightarrow M$ has constant rank $n$, the [constant rank theorem](../../../calculus.md#constant-rank-theorem) gives coordinates $y^1,\ldots,y^n$ on $N$ and $x^1,\ldots,x^m$ on $M$ in which

$$
\iota(y^1,\ldots,y^n)=(y^1,\ldots,y^n,0,\ldots,0).
$$

Since $\iota$ is an embedding, the ambient chart can be shrunk so that it meets no other local sheet of $N$. It then satisfies

$$
\psi(V\cap N)=\{x\in\psi(V):x^{n+1}=\cdots=x^m=0\},
$$

and $(x^1,\ldots,x^n)$ restricts to the required chart on $N$. This is a [slice chart for an embedded submanifold](../../../differential-geometry.md#slice-chart-for-an-embedded-submanifold).

Suppose the immersed subset is not embedded. Using the assumed embedded neighborhoods, there are $p\in N$, a relatively small coordinate neighborhood $U\ni p$, and points $p_j\in N\setminus U$ with $p_j\to p$ in $M$. Choose a [bump function](../../../partial-differential-equation.md#smooth-bump-function) $g$ on $N$, supported in $U$, with $g(p)=1$. Then $g(p_j)=0$.

If $g=f|_N$ for some smooth $f$ on $M$, continuity gives both $f(p_j)\to f(p)=1$ and $f(p_j)=0$, a contradiction. Thus the extension hypothesis forces the subspace and manifold topologies to agree locally, and the immersion is an embedding. This proves the [smooth extension criterion for an immersed submanifold](../../../differential-geometry.md#smooth-extension-criterion-for-an-immersed-submanifold).

If $X$ is tangent to $N$ and $f|_N=0$, then the restriction of $f$ to every curve in $N$ is zero, so $(Xf)|_N=0$.

Conversely, use a [slice chart for an embedded submanifold](../../../differential-geometry.md#slice-chart-for-an-embedded-submanifold). The functions $x^{n+1},\ldots,x^m$ vanish on $N$. Writing $X=X^i\partial_i$, the hypothesis gives

$$
Xx^\alpha=X^\alpha=0\quad\text{on }N,\qquad \alpha>n.
$$

**Thus $X$ has no normal component and is tangent to $N$. Equivalently, $X$ preserves the [vanishing ideal of an embedded submanifold](../../../differential-geometry.md#vanishing-ideal-of-an-embedded-submanifold).**

The [Lie bracket of vector fields](../../../differential-geometry.md#lie-bracket-of-vector-fields) is the commutator of the corresponding derivations:

$$
[X,Y]f=X(Yf)-Y(Xf).
$$

For $X=X^i\partial_i$ and $Y=Y^i\partial_i$,

$$
\boxed{[X,Y]=\left(X^i\partial_iY^k-Y^i\partial_iX^k\right)\partial_k.}
$$

Let $I(N)$ be the [vanishing ideal of an embedded submanifold](../../../differential-geometry.md#vanishing-ideal-of-an-embedded-submanifold). Tangency says $X(I(N)),Y(I(N))\subseteq I(N)$. Hence, for $h\in I(N)$,

$$
[X,Y]h=X(Yh)-Y(Xh)\in I(N),
$$

so the criterion from part (d) makes $[X,Y]$ tangent to $N$.

In adapted coordinates, the tangential coefficients of the displayed bracket use only the restrictions of the tangential coefficients of $X,Y$ and their derivatives along $N$; all normal coefficients vanish there. Consequently

$$
[X,Y]|_N=[X|_N,Y|_N],
$$

so the restriction depends only on $X|_N$ and $Y|_N$. This is [tangency under the Lie bracket](../../../differential-geometry.md#tangency-under-the-lie-bracket).

For $\pi:E\to B$, the vertical space at $p\in E$ is $V_pE=\ker(d\pi)_p$. A horizontal subspace is a complementary subspace

$$
T_pE=V_pE\oplus H_pE.
$$

A connection is a smooth choice of such complements, linear with respect to the vector-bundle structure. Equivalently, it is a smooth horizontal distribution as in [horizontal subspace of a vector bundle connection](../../../fiber-bundle.md#horizontal-subspace-of-a-vector-bundle-connection).

Put $b=\pi(p)$ and $u=(d\pi)_p v$. Choose a vector field $X$ near $b$ with $X(b)=u$, multiply it by a [bump function](../../../partial-differential-equation.md#smooth-bump-function), and extend it by zero to $B$. At each $q\in E$, the restriction

$$
(d\pi)_q:H_qE\longrightarrow T_{\pi(q)}B
$$

is an isomorphism. Define $V(q)$ as the unique horizontal lift of $X(\pi(q))$. Smoothness of the horizontal distribution makes $V$ smooth, and uniqueness gives $V(p)=v$.

Take bundle charts $\Phi_i:E|_{U_i}\to U_i\times\mathbb R^r$ with transition functions $g_{ij}:U_i\cap U_j\to GL(r,\mathbb R)$. Over $f^{-1}(U_i)$ define

$$
\widetilde\Phi_i(p,v)=(p,\operatorname{pr}_2\Phi_i(v)).
$$

Their transition functions are $g_{ij}\circ f$, so they give the fibre product

$$
f^*E=\coprod_{p\in M}E_{f(p)}
$$

a smooth manifold and make its projection to $M$ a rank-$r$ [pullback vector bundle](../../../fiber-bundle.md#pullback-vector-bundle).

A local section $s:U\to E$ determines the section

$$
p\longmapsto(p,s(f(p)))
$$

of $f^*E$ over $f^{-1}(U)$. It is unique with second component $s\circ f$.

A covariant derivative is an $\mathbb R$-linear map

$$
d_A:\Gamma(E)\to\Omega^1(B;E)
$$

satisfying $d_A(fs)=df\otimes s+f\,d_As$. It is local: its value over an open set depends only on the restriction of the section there. A horizontal connection differentiates a section, projects its derivative vertically, and identifies the vertical tangent with the fibre.

In a local frame write $d_As=ds+A_is\,dy^i$. If $x^a$ are coordinates on $M$, the defining identity in the question forces

$$
d_{A'}(s\circ f)=d(s\circ f)+A'_a(s\circ f)\,dx^a
$$

with

$$
\boxed{A'_a(x)=A_i(f(x))\frac{\partial f^i}{\partial x^a}(x).}
$$

**Thus $A'=f^*A$, the [pullback connection](../../../fiber-bundle.md#pullback-connection).**

For local coordinates $x^1,\ldots,x^n$, a curve is an affinely parametrized [geodesic](../../../riemannian-geometry.md#geodesic) exactly when it satisfies the [geodesic equation](../../../riemannian-geometry.md#geodesic-equation)

$$
\boxed{\ddot x^k+\Gamma^k_{ij}(x)\dot x^i\dot x^j=0,\qquad k=1,\ldots,n,}

where the [Christoffel symbols](../../../riemannian-geometry.md#christoffel-symbol) of the [Levi-Civita connection](../../../general-relativity.md#levi-civita-connection) are

$$
\boxed{\Gamma^k_{ij}=\frac12g^{k\ell}
(\partial_i g_{j\ell}+\partial_jg_{i\ell}-\partial_\ell g_{ij}).}

For $v$ near $0\in T_pM$, let $\gamma_v$ be the unique geodesic with $\gamma_v(0)=p$ and $\dot\gamma_v(0)=v$. The [exponential map](../../../riemannian-geometry.md#exponential-map-riemannian-geometry) is $\exp_p(v)=\gamma_v(1)$.

The constant initial velocity $0$ gives $\exp_p(0)=p$. Varying the initial velocity through $sv$ yields $\exp_p(sv)=\gamma_v(s)$, so

$$
(d\exp_p)_0(v)=\left.\frac d{ds}\right|_{0}\exp_p(sv)=v.
$$

**Thus $(d\exp_p)_0$ is the identity. The [inverse function theorem](../../../calculus.md#inverse-function-theorem) makes $\exp_p$ a diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of $0$ onto a neighborhood of $p$. Coordinates from an orthonormal basis of $T_pM$ are the [geodesic normal coordinates](../../../riemannian-geometry.md#geodesic-normal-coordinates).**

In geodesic coordinates built from an orthonormal basis, $g_{ij}(0)=\delta_{ij}$. Every radial curve has coordinates $x(t)=ta$, and substitution into the [geodesic equation](../../../riemannian-geometry.md#geodesic-equation) gives

$$
a^ia^j\Gamma^k_{ij}(ta)=0.
$$

Taking $t=1$ proves $x^ix^j\Gamma^k_{ij}(x)=0$.

Conversely, assume the metric and Christoffel-symbol conditions. For every $a$ in the star domain, $x(t)=ta$ satisfies the geodesic equation and has initial velocity $a$ in an orthonormal coordinate frame. Uniqueness of solutions to ordinary differential equations gives $\phi^{-1}(ta)=\exp_p(ta)$ wherever defined. The star-domain assumption covers all of $U$, so $\phi$ is precisely a geodesic coordinate chart. This is the [Radial Christoffel-symbol criterion for geodesic coordinates](../../../riemannian-geometry.md#radial-christoffel-symbol-criterion-for-geodesic-coordinates).

The metric induces an inner product on decomposable $r$-forms by

$$
\langle\alpha_1\wedge\cdots\wedge\alpha_r,
\beta_1\wedge\cdots\wedge\beta_r\rangle
=\det(\langle\alpha_i,\beta_j\rangle),
$$

extended bilinearly. On an oriented Riemannian manifold, the [Hodge star operator](../../../differential-form.md#hodge-star-operator) is characterized by

$$
\alpha\wedge *\beta=\langle\alpha,\beta\rangle\,d\operatorname{vol}_g.
$$

On $r$-forms in dimension $n$,

$$

Put $\alpha=\delta\eta$. The hypothesis says that the exact two-form $\beta=d\alpha$ is [anti-self-dual](../../../differential-form.md#anti-self-dual-differential-form). Since $M$ is compact without boundary, [Stokes theorem](../../../calculus.md#stokes-theorem) gives

$$
0=\int_Md(\alpha\wedge d\alpha)
=\int_M\beta\wedge\beta
=-\int_M\beta\wedge *\beta
=-\|\beta\|_{L^2}^2.
$$

Hence $d\alpha=0$ by the [exact anti-self-dual form on a compact four-manifold](../../../differential-form.md#exact-anti-self-dual-form-on-a-compact-four-manifold) argument. Since $\delta$ is the formal $L^2$ adjoint of $d$,

$$
\|\delta\eta\|_{L^2}^2
=\langle\delta\eta,\alpha\rangle_{L^2}
=\langle\eta,d\alpha\rangle_{L^2}=0.
$$

Therefore $\boxed{\delta\eta=0}$.
