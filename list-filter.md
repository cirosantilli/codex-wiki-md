# List filter

↑ **Parent:** [Functional programming](functional-programming.md)

Keep exactly the elements of a [list](list-abstract-data-type.md) satisfying a [predicate](predicate.md), preserving their relative order. A recursive step tests the head, prepending it to the filtered tail when it passes and otherwise returning that filtered tail alone. On a finite input, this uses one predicate evaluation per element; an infinite rejected tail cannot produce a next output under [lazy evaluation](lazy-evaluation.md).
